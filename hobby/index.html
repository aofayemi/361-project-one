<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I like to travel, try new food and learn about different culture. On my spare time,
  I like to visit places I have never been to around the city. One of the thing I do is
  take the CTA bus that i have never been on before and visit the area around the bus route.
  It makes me learn about the diversity of the city and different culture. </p>
